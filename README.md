# layer2-security-labs
Labs focused on simulating and mitigating Layer 2 network attacks (DHCP starvation, ARP spoofing, STP root attack) using SCAPY, Jupyter, and Cisco IOS. Built and tested in EVE-NG.

# Layer 2 Security Labs

This repository contains practical exercises on Layer 2 network security using Cisco switches and Linux-based tools. The labs were conducted in a virtual environment to simulate attacks and mitigation techniques targeting core Layer 2 protocols such as DHCP, ARP, and STP.

## Labs Included

- Lab 4: Secure Layer 2 – ARP/DHCP/STP Spoofing Protection using Scapy and L2SEC mechanisms
- Lab 5: Post-exploitation techniques and network pivoting using Metasploit

## Environment

All labs were performed in a GNS3-based topology, using Cisco switches, routers, Kali Linux, and Ubuntu servers. The virtual environment allowed safe simulation of common Layer 2 threats and their mitigations.

## Objectives

- Analyze vulnerabilities in Layer 2 protocols.
- Perform attacks such as DHCP starvation, rogue DHCP, ARP spoofing, and STP manipulation.
- Deploy mitigation techniques: DHCP Snooping, DAI, BPDU Guard, and Port Security.
- Use Metasploit to perform lateral movement, establish reverse shells, and maintain access.
- Practice red team techniques including enumeration, brute-force attacks, and persistence.
